# Finding letter 'e'

We first compute the frequency of each letter in the ciphertext, the tool shows the three
most frequent letters are 'O', 'G', and 'B', appearing 59, 55, and 38 times respctively.
Since 'e' is the most frequent letter in average English text, we first make the guess that
'e' corresponds to 'O' in the ciphertext.

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : --------------e-----------


# Finding pair 'th'

'th' is one of the most frequent bigrams in average English text, whereas the reverse 'ht'
seldom appears. By looking at the bigram frequencies in the cipher text, we find the most
frequent bigrams are 'GP' for 19 times, 'PO' for 14 times, and 'TC' for 10 times. Their
reverse 'PG', 'OP', and 'CT' appear 4, 1, and 0 time respectively. Since we have assumed 'O'
to be 'e', the bigram 'GP' is a good candidate for 'th'.

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : ------t-------eh----------


# Finding letter 'a'

We then try to find the letter 'a' because it's a vowel and it may appear in the word 'that',
where all other letters have been fixed. By searching for the pattern 'th-t' in the partial
decryption, we find two occurrences:

    GPCGGPOONO
    th-tthee-e
    
    OCGPZGICR (end)
    e-th-t---

The context of the first case being more complete, 'C' is a good candidate to 'a' due to the
appearance of the combination 'that the'. But 'Z' may also be 'a'. Let's look at the result of
Sukhotin's algorithm for further evidence:

    Putative vowels: O G B C Z E
       O   G   B   C   Z   E
    O  5   2   1   3   1   2
    G  4   4   4   1   5   0
    B  0   1   0   0   0   0
    C  0   8   0   0   0   1
    Z  0   7   2   0   0   0
    E  0   1   1   3   1   0
    --------------------------
       e   a   o   i   u   y  
    e  1   3   2   1   0   0
    a  0   0   0   0   0   1
    o  0   0   1   0   4   0
    i  1   0   3   0   0   0
    u  0   0   0   0   0   0
    y  0   0   1   0   0   0

Again, 'C' and 'Z' are all suggested to be vowels. Moreover, we observe that in average English
text the bigram 'at' appears more frequently than 'ta' by 3 times roughly. Since we have fixed
'G' to be 't', we refer again to the bigram analysis to find:

    'CG' appears 8 times and 'GC' appears 1 time
    'ZG' appears 7 times and 'GZ' appears 5 times

Here, the results show 'C' is more likely to be 'a'.

# Finding word patterns

## Letters 'b' and 'n'

We try to find partially complete word or phrase, near the end of the cipher text we have:

    MOROCGPZGICR
    -e-eath-t-a-

'-e-eath' makes us think of the word 'beneath', so we suppose 'M' and 'R' to be 'b' and 'n'
and see what happends.

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : --a---t-----b-eh-n--------

## Letter 's'

We also find the pattern:

    CGGPOMOSG
    atthebe-t

We see the phrase 'atthebest' so we suppose 'S' to be 's'. 

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : --a---t-----b-eh-ns-------

## Letters 'i' and 'w'

Moreover, the beginning of the ciphertext gives:

    (beginning) ZGTCS
                -t-as

We suppose 'Z' to be 'i' and 'T' to be 'w' to produce the beginning 'itwas'.

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : --a---t-----b-eh-nsw-----i

## Letter 'k'

We have also found:

    PCGOTOOKGPO
    hatewee-the

The preceding 'hate' and the following 'the' suggest 'wee-' to be a word by itself. Though the
signification of 'hate week' is not clear to us, we suppose 'K' to be 'k'.

    Cipher: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Clear : --a---t---k-b-eh-nsw-----i

## Vowels 'o' and 'u'

In order to find the remaining vowels, we recall the result of Sukhotin's algorithm:

    Putative vowels: O G B C Z E
       O   G   B   C   Z   E
    O  5   2   1   3   1   2
    G  4   4   4   1   5   0
    B  0   1   0   0   0   0
    C  0   8   0   0   0   1
    Z  0   7   2   0   0   0
    E  0   1   1   3   1   0
    --------------------------
       e   a   o   i   u   y  
    e  1   3   2   1   0   0
    a  0   0   0   0   0   1
    o  0   0   1   0   4   0
    i  1   0   3   0   0   0
    u  0   0   0   0   0   0
    y  0   0   1   0   0   0

This suggests 'B' and 'E' to be in the set of remaining vowels 'o', 'u' and 'y'. And we find in
the ciphertext:

    CMBQGTPOR
    ab--twhen

Given the complete word 'when' and our guess about 'B', the pattern 'ab--t' is probably 'about',
with 'B' mapping to 'o' and 'Q' to 'u'.

# Remaining letters

Upon seeing the partially completed sentence:

    MZFMIBGPOIZSTCGWPZRFNBQ
    bi-b-othe-iswat-hin--ou

Intuition gives 'bigbrotheriswatchingyou', so we suppose 'F', 'I', 'W', 'N' to be respectively 'g',
'r', 'c', 'y'. This completes a lot the key.
